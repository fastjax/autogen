# RadixTree

**Generate a [Radix Tree][radix-tree] of keywords as a Java `Enum` for time-optimized lookup operations.**

## Usage

This module takes a list of keywords as an input, and produces a Java `Enum` that allows incremental, optimized lookup operations.

With the generated `Enum`, a program can thereafter perform lookups for matching keywords, character by character. Each next character narrows the search space of the matching enums by stepping deeper into the radix tree.

## Performance

lookup operations are performed incrementally. Each next character narrows the search space of the matching enums by stepping deeper into the radix tree. At each character input, a binary search is performed for the terms that have been narrowed by the previous character. Each Radix Tree `Enum` therefore has different specific performance, because it is based on the chosen keywords.

```
  Let: n·µ¢ = average number of keyword nodes at depth ùñé
  Let: ùñó  = average number of keyword characters (i.e. average depth of the radix tree)
```

The first character lookup performs in `O(log n‚ÇÄ)` time, where `n‚ÇÄ` is the number of children of the node matched from the 1st character.<br>
The next character lookup performs in `O(log n‚ÇÅ)` time, where `n‚ÇÅ` is the number of children of the node matched from the 2nd character.<br>
The next character lookup performs in `O(log n‚ÇÇ)` time, where `n‚ÇÇ` is the number of children of the node matched from the 3rd character.<br>
The next character lookup performs in `O(log n‚ÇÉ)` time, and so on...

### Large Lists

For large lists of keywords, each character lookup after the first is performed in `O(log n·µ£‚Çä‚ÇÅ)` time. Each next lookup reduces with the subsequent lookup by the square, on average. As ùñé approaches ùñó, Big-O complexity approaches constant time. The performance of whole-word lookups for large lists can be expressed as:

```
  ·µ£                   ·µ£
  ‚àë O(log n·µ¢) = O(log ‚àè n·µ¢) ‚âà O(log n‚ÇÄ)
 ‚Å±‚Åº‚Å∞                 ‚Å±‚Åº‚Å∞
```

### Small Lists

For small lists of keywords, the same rules apply as for large lists. For small lists, however, Big-O complexity approaches constant time even faster, resulting in the same estimate:

```
  O(log n‚ÇÄ)
```
